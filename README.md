# Kayaba Labs NFT Course Completion Certificate System

## 🎓 Project Overview

A blockchain-based certificate system that issues NFT credentials to students who complete courses at Kayaba Labs. Each certificate is a soulbound (non-transferable) NFT with auto-generated student IDs, stored permanently on the blockchain.

### Key Features

- ✅ **Auto-Generated Student IDs** - Unique IDs (KL-SOL-0001, KL-SOL-0002, etc.)
- ✅ **Soulbound NFTs** - Cannot be transferred, ensuring authenticity
- ✅ **Dual Minting Options** - Students self-mint OR admin bulk mints
- ✅ **Fee Collection** - $0.50 fee per self-mint, free for bulk mints
- ✅ **On-Chain Storage** - Student ID, course name, and completion date stored on blockchain
- ✅ **IPFS Metadata** - Images and additional data stored on decentralized storage
- ✅ **OpenSea Compatible** - Viewable on major NFT marketplaces
- ✅ **Low Cost** - Deployed on L2 networks (~$0.01-0.05 per mint)

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Smart Contract

**File:** `src/KayabaCourseCompletionNFT.sol`

**Core Functions:**

```solidity
// Student self-mint (pays $0.50)
function mintCertificate(address to, string course, string date) 
    public payable returns (uint256, string)

// Admin bulk mint (free)
function batchMintCertificates(address[] recipients, string course, string[] dates) 
    public onlyOwner returns (string[])

// Fee withdrawal
function withdrawFees() public onlyOwner

// Data retrieval
function getCertificateInfo(uint256 tokenId) 
    public view returns (string studentId, string course, string date, address wallet)
```

**Technology Stack:**
- Solidity 0.8.29
- OpenZeppelin Contracts (ERC721, Ownable)
- Foundry for development and testing

### Data Storage

**On-Chain (Smart Contract):**
- Student ID (auto-generated)
- Course name
- Completion date
- Token ownership

**Off-Chain (IPFS):**
- Certificate image
- Metadata JSON
- Additional attributes

**Current IPFS:**
- Image: `ipfs://bafkreiawpz2cyeckfyjck5ugdkpekcoot2t2ooprmptzqwc4kixc7h3pli`
- Metadata: `https://coral-genuine-koi-966.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafkreia6rxkezois2eymzxbikacx5egnrfvteqsky6gcswscjzmlummccu`

## 💰 Economics

### Minting Fee: $0.50 (0.0003 ETH)

**Revenue Model:**

**Option 1: Self-Mint (Student Pays)**
- Student pays: $0.50 + gas (~$0.01-0.05)
- You collect: $0.50 per certificate
- 100 students = $50 revenue

**Option 2: Bulk Mint (You Pay Gas, Collect via Stripe)**
- Student pays: $0.50 via Stripe
- Your cost: ~$1-5 per 100 students (gas)
- Net: $45-49 per 100 students

**Recommended:** Include $0.50 in course price, bulk mint for best UX

### Network Costs (L2 Deployment)

| Network | Deploy | Per Mint | Total (100 mints) |
|---------|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Scroll | $2-5 | $0.01-0.05 | $3-10 |
| Base | $2-5 | $0.01-0.05 | $3-10 |
| Arbitrum | $2-5 | $0.01-0.05 | $3-10 |
| Polygon | $1-3 | $0.005-0.02 | $1.50-5 |

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Deploy to Mainnet (1 hour)
Follow `DEPLOYMENT.md` to deploy to Scroll or Base

### Step 2: Mint Test Certificates (15 minutes)
Mint 2-3 test certificates to verify everything works

### Step 3: Verify OpenSea Integration (30 minutes)
Wait 30 minutes, check if certificates appear on OpenSea

### Step 4: Build Minting Page (2-4 hours)
Create simple HTML page for student self-minting

### Step 5: Setup Payment Processing (2-3 hours)
Integrate Stripe for bulk mint option

**Estimated Time to Launch:** 1-2 days

---

## 📊 Success Metrics (30-Day Goals)

- [ ] Contract deployed to mainnet
- [ ] 50+ certificates minted
- [ ] $25+ in fees collected
- [ ] 90%+ student satisfaction
- [ ] <5 support tickets
- [ ] Certificates visible on OpenSea
- [ ] Zero security incidents

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Implemented ✅
- ✅ Ownable pattern (only owner can batch mint)
- ✅ Fee validation (requires exact payment)
- ✅ Soulbound transfers (prevents selling)
- ✅ Input validation (non-empty course names)
- ✅ Excess payment refunds

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Multi-signature wallet for withdrawals
- [ ] Rate limiting on minting
- [ ] Emergency pause functionality
- [ ] Upgradeable proxy pattern (if needed)
