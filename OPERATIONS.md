### "I lost access to my wallet"

**Response:**
```
Unfortunately, we cannot recover access to your wallet.

HOWEVER, we can mint a new certificate to a new wallet address:
1. Create a new MetaMask wallet
2. Send us the new address
3. We'll mint a duplicate certificate (one-time exception)

For future: ALWAYS backup your seed phrase!

## 📈 Growth & Scaling

### When to Create New Contracts

Create separate contracts for:
- ✅ Different courses (Solidity vs Rust vs Move)
- ✅ Different achievement types (Hackathons, Projects)
- ✅ Different organizations/partners
- ✅ Major curriculum updates

### Batch Mint Limits

Safe batch sizes:
- **10-50 students:** Single transaction
- **50-100 students:** Still fine, ~$1-2 gas
- **100-500 students:** Consider 2-3 batches
- **500+ students:** Split into 100-student batches

### Automation Opportunities

**Consider building:**
1. Automated minting on course completion
2. Payment webhook integration (Stripe → Auto-mint)
3. Student dashboard to view certificates
4. Analytics dashboard for your team
5. API for third-party integrations

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### Daily Operations

- ✅ Never share private key
- ✅ Use hardware wallet for large operations
- ✅ Verify contract address before transactions
- ✅ Test on small batches first
- ✅ Keep backup of all student data
- ✅ Monitor contract for suspicious activity
- ✅ Withdraw fees regularly (don't let large balance accumulate)

### Access Control

- ✅ Only owner can batch mint (already enforced)
- ✅ Only owner can withdraw fees (already enforced)
- ✅ Keep deployment wallet separate from personal wallet
- ✅ Use multi-sig for high-value operations (future)
