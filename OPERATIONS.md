## 🆘 Student Support FAQ

### "I don't have a wallet"

**Response:**
```
No problem! Here's how to get started:

1. Install MetaMask: https://metamask.io
2. Create new wallet (save your seed phrase!)
3. Get your wallet address (0x...)
4. Send it to us or use it to mint

Video guide: {YOUR_TUTORIAL_LINK}

Need help? We can mint for you if you provide your wallet address.
```

### "How do I get ETH on Scroll?"

**Response:**
```
You can get ETH on Scroll in two ways:

OPTION 1 - Bridge (if you have ETH on Ethereum):
1. Go to: https://scroll.io/bridge
2. Connect MetaMask
3. Bridge minimum 0.001 ETH
4. Wait 15 minutes

OPTION 2 - Buy from Exchange:
1. Buy ETH on Binance/Coinbase
2. Withdraw to Scroll network
3. Use your MetaMask address

OR: We can mint for you! Just pay $0.50 via Stripe and provide your wallet address.
```

### "Where is my NFT?"

**Response:**
```
Your NFT is in your wallet! View it:

METHOD 1 - MetaMask:
1. Open MetaMask
2. Switch to Scroll network
3. Click "NFTs" tab
4. You should see "Kayaba Labs Certificate"

METHOD 2 - OpenSea:
Go to: https://opensea.io/assets/scroll/{CONTRACT_ADDRESS}/{TOKEN_ID}

METHOD 3 - Check on Explorer:
Go to: https://scrollscan.com/token/{CONTRACT_ADDRESS}?a={TOKEN_ID}

Still don't see it? Reply with your wallet address and we'll check.
```

### "Can I transfer my certificate?"

**Response:**
```
No, certificates are "soulbound" - they cannot be transferred.

This ensures:
✅ Authentic verification (you earned it!)
✅ Cannot be sold or given away
✅ Permanent proof of YOUR achievement

The certificate stays with your wallet forever.
```

### "I lost access to my wallet"

**Response:**
```
Unfortunately, we cannot recover access to your wallet.

HOWEVER, we can mint a new certificate to a new wallet address:
1. Create a new MetaMask wallet
2. Send us the new address
3. We'll mint a duplicate certificate (one-time exception)

For future: ALWAYS backup your seed phrase!
```

## 📈 Growth & Scaling

### When to Create New Contracts

Create separate contracts for:
- ✅ Different courses (Solidity vs Rust vs Move)
- ✅ Different achievement types (Hackathons, Projects)
- ✅ Different organizations/partners
- ✅ Major curriculum updates

### Batch Mint Limits

Safe batch sizes:
- **10-50 students:** Single transaction
- **50-100 students:** Still fine, ~$1-2 gas
- **100-500 students:** Consider 2-3 batches
- **500+ students:** Split into 100-student batches

### Automation Opportunities

**Consider building:**
1. Automated minting on course completion
2. Payment webhook integration (Stripe → Auto-mint)
3. Student dashboard to view certificates
4. Analytics dashboard for your team
5. API for third-party integrations

---

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### Daily Operations

- ✅ Never share private key
- ✅ Use hardware wallet for large operations
- ✅ Verify contract address before transactions
- ✅ Test on small batches first
- ✅ Keep backup of all student data
- ✅ Monitor contract for suspicious activity
- ✅ Withdraw fees regularly (don't let large balance accumulate)

### Access Control

- ✅ Only owner can batch mint (already enforced)
- ✅ Only owner can withdraw fees (already enforced)
- ✅ Keep deployment wallet separate from personal wallet
- ✅ Use multi-sig for high-value operations (future)
